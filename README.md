# ETL-in-python
This project makes the ETL (extract, transform, load) process in Python using SQLAlchemy library and PostgresSQL, it gives insights exported into a xlsx file. All of the process was made with Python, perhaps it's important to create the initial tables structure in PostgreSQL before running this code (the repository has the SQL file with the necessary queries).
